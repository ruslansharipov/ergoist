# Ergoist
Ergonomic fully split wireless keyboard

Main features: 
- ortholinear layout with 42 keys including 3 keys thumb cluster (just like on corne)
- all keys are 1u to make it easier to find keycaps
- pcb has big cutaway for battery, that can fit 35x30 lipo battery (should fit lipo 503035 500mA)
- designed to be used with Seeduino Xiao
- wireless only. Wired version will be supported it in future
- no screen integration (yet?)
- power switch (longer battery life, no accidental presses during transportation)
- works with ZMK, latest config can be found [here](https://github.com/ruslansharipov/ergoist-zmk-config)
- reversible PCB makes it cheaper in production (usually you can't order less than 5 pieces, so having 5 of those will make you able to assemble 2.5 keyboards)

Status:
- ~~pcb v0.1 in production~~ received, assembled, tested
- case **re**design
